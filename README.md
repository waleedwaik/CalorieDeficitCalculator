# CalorieDeficitCalculator
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I created a simple website that can calculate the calorie surplus or deficit and help people gain or lose weight.
Most of the design in this site was made using BOOTSTRAP a little CSS, JAVASCRIPT and of course HTML.

The slider and all its function are all bootstrap, links are attached in the script which gives every functionality to the bootstrap slider;

Images used are placed in the 'img' folder, the logo and all other images.

Logos/Icons were created by me

Images were taken from the following websites:
